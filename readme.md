# Cyclistics Bike Analysis - a Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
---

The Google Data Analytics Certificate program in Coursera includes a case study for a Capstone project. 

The following problems are the focus of the study and the project requires you to choose to analyze the data by answering any of the following questions:
Addressing the following will guide the future marketing strategy:

- How annual members and casual riders differ in using the bikes

- Why casual riders would buy an annual membership

- How digital media can affect their marketing tactics to influence casual riders to become members

- What are the trends on the historical bike trip data

For this project, I have selected the first question. This is a case study to identify and explore differences on how annual members and casual riders use the Cyclistics Bike Share program.

My 4th wall: This case study is originally intended for R. My personal goal however is to specialize in Python. I have deviated from using R so I can explore the python libraries.

The data visualization for the project can be reviewed using the Jupyter Notebook or the Dash application.

This project has the following file structure:
